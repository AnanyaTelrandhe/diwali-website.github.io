    <p  style=" font-style: italic;color: aquamarine;background-color: blueviolet;font-weight: bold; font">Diwali is a much-awaited festival in the country. The festival marks the return of Lord Rama along with Sita and Lakshman from 14 years of exile. In order to welcome them, the citizens of Ayodhya lighted diyas and celebrated the festival with much enthusiasm. The ritual has been continued from years. People decorate their houses and light diyas and candles and worship goddess Lakshmi as she is believed to bring prosperity. People make rangoli and share Diwali wishes with each other.</p>
